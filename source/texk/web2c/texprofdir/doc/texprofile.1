.SH NAME

.PP
texprofile
\- Displaying the profile data collected by texprof\&.
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
texprofile
[Options] \fIinputfile\fP
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION

texprofile
reads the binary \fIinputfile\fP
as produced by 
texprof\&.
The extension \&.tprof
of the input file can be 
omitted. It analyses the data and presents the results in a variety of 
tables, either optimized for human readability or as CSV (comma 
separated values) files for further processing. 
.PP
The output is written to the standard output stream where it can be redirected 
to a file or viewed immediately. 
.PP
.SH OPTIONS

There are four types of options: general options, table options, 
selection options, and formatting options. 
.PP
The general options: 
.TP
\fB\-?\fP \fB\-h\fP \fB\-\-help\fP
 Display a short help text and exit the program. 
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fP
 Display the version information and exit. 
.PP
The table options determine the tables that will be displayed. 
These options all use upper case letters. 
If no table option is given, only some global information is shown. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-T\fP
 Show the table of the top 10 input lines. 
.TP
\fB\-G\fP
 Show the table of the macro call graph. 
.TP
\fB\-C\fP
 Show the table of times per TeX command. 
.TP
\fB\-L\fP
 Show the table of times per input line. 
.TP
\fB\-R\fP
 Show the table of raw time stamps. 
.TP
\fB\-S\fP
 Show the table of macro stack changes. 
.TP
\fB\-F\fP
 Show the table of all input files. 
.TP
\fB\-M\fP
 Show the table of all macros called. 
.TP
\fB\-A\fP
 Show important tables (equal to \-TGFC) tables. 
.TP
\fB\-N\fP
 Do not show the table of global information. 
.PP
The selection options allow to reduce the amount of data that is shown 
in the table by omitting table entries that contribute little to the 
overall runtime. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-p\fP\fIn\fP
 Do not show information for table entries 
with cumulative time below \fIn\fP
percent. The default is 1.0 percent. 
.TP
\fB\-t\fP\fIn\fP
 Limit the number of input lines shown in the 
table of the ``Top Ten\&'' to \fIn\fP\&.
This option is only useful 
with the \fB\-T\fP
option. 
.PP
The formatting option determine the formatting of the information in the tables 
as well as the selection of information that is shown in the tables. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-i\fP
 Add the macros file and line numbers after the macro name. 
This option is useful to distinguish two macros that share 
the same name. 
.TP
\fB\-m\fP
 Optimize output for machine readability. When optimized for human readability, 
times are rounded and given in a short form adding a unit identifier: 
s for seconds, ms for milliseconds, us for micro seconds, and ns for 
nanoseconds. This format is inconvenient if you want to import the data 
for example into a spread\-sheet for further processing. 
With the \fB\-m\fP
option times are simply given in nano seconds without units. 
Similar the combined time for the total time used for a macro and the 
time used as a sub\-macro from the call graph is given in a single column 
with a slash separating both numbers is nice for human readers. 
With the \fB\-m\fP
option both numbers will simply be given in separate columns. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-n\fP
 Show the time stamp numbers. This option is useful together with 
the \fB\-R\fP
option, if you import the table into a database or spread\-sheet. 
If you sort the data by various properties into different 
categories, the time stamp number can be used to keeping the entries 
within a category sorted by time. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-s\fP
 Show the changes of the macro stack. 
This option is useful with the \fB\-R\fP
option if you want to see the changes 
in the macro stack (see \fB\-S\fP)
together with the timing information in 
a single table. 
.PP
.SH DATA FORMATS

.SS FILE NUMBERS
While texprof
is running, every TeX input file is given a 
unique file number. The file name alone is often not unique because 
two files in different directories might have the same file 
name. Displaying the full file name with the complete path is however often 
not very 
convenient. So if you observe the same file name together with 
different file numbers, you can use the option \fB\-F\fP
to get a table of all 
file numbers and their full file names. 
.PP
But even within the same 
directory, TeX can read different files with the same name during one 
run: TeX can open a file for writing, write content to the file, close 
it, open it for reading, read it and close it again. Then TeX might 
repeat this process a second time, or multiple times, reusing the same 
file name over and over again. texprof
will assign a new file 
number to this file each time it is opened for reading. So you can 
tell from the sequence of file numbers which one was the first, the 
second, or the third. 
.PP
Last not least, there are some special file 
numbers: 
.TP
0 \- unknown 
If the file is unknown, which should rarely happen, 
the file number 0 is used. 
.TP
1\- system 
texprof
will map 
time intervals that are used to execute certain system routines 
to the ``system\&'' pseudo file 
using the line numbers to identify the specific routine 
like producing the output DVI file (shipout), breaking 
a paragraph into lines (linebrk), or breaking the 
document into pages (buildpg). These times do not depend on the 
use of macros but simply on the size of the document. 
.TP
2 \- terminal 
TeX commands entered on the command line or interactively are mapped 
to file number 2. 
.PP
.SS TIME
If the option \fB\-m\fP
is given times are given as nanoseconds. 
Otherwise, times are rounded to at most 4 digits precission and displayed 
with a unit: seconds (s), milliseconds (ms), microseconds (um), or nanoseconds (ns). 
.PP
.SS MACRO NAMES
Macro names are shown with the leading backslash. 
Since macro names are often not unique, the command line option \fB\-i\fP
can be used to show after the macro name in square brackets the file number 
and the line number where the macro is defined. 
Unless two macros with the same name are 
defined in the same file and line this is sufficient to uniquely 
identify a macro. A macro defined with ``let\&'' results in a complet copy 
of the original macro. Therefore it will not reference 
the file and line of the ``let\&'' command but the same file and line as 
the original macro. 
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES

Let\&'s assume that you issue the command texprof
\fB\-prof\fP
\fIhello.tex\fP\&.
This will run texprof
on the input file \fIhello.tex\fP
with option \fB\-prof\fP\&.
The program texprof
will load the plain TeX format and then 
process hello.tex
to produce hello.log
and hello.dvi\&.
It will execute exactly the same steps that TeX would execute if you had 
issued the command tex
\fIhello.tex\fP\&.
.PP
In addition to hello.log
and hello.dvi,
texprof
will 
also produce the file hello.tprof
containing time measurements 
made while texprof
was running. 
The option \fB\-prof\fP
will switch on the gathering of 
timing data as soon as texprof
enters its main control procedure; 
The file hello.tprof
will contain a time measurement, called a time 
stamp, for every command that TeX executed while processing the input. 
A binary format is used to store all that data in a simple and compact 
form. Still the file hello.tprof
might become very big. 
.PP
The program texprofile
is used to extract and analyse the 
data contained in hello.tprof
and produce useful output. 
Here are some examples: 
.PP
.TP
texprofile \fIhello\fP
 Without further options texprofile
will write some general 
information to the standard output, like the total time measured, 
the number of samples, the average time per sample, etc. 
The general information is always given unless explicitely disabled 
with the \fB\-N\fP
option or with the \fB\-m\fP
option. 
.PP
.TP
texprofile \fB\-T\fP \fIhello\fP
 With the option \fB\-T\fP,
texprofile
will map each time stamp 
to a specific line of input, add up the time intervalls for each input 
line separately, and output a table showing the ten lines that have 
the highest cummulative time. 
The table has the following seven columns: 
.RS
.TP
1. file 
The first column contains the input file number as explained above. 
The input file name if shown in column 7. 
.RS
.PP
.RE
.TP
2. line 
The line number. 
.TP
3. percent 
The time spent in this line and file as a percentage of the total 
time measured as given as part of the general information. 
.TP
4. absolute 
The absolute time spent in this line and file. 
.TP
5. count 
The number of times the execution path entered this line. 
Note, that a 
macro call usually redirects the execution path to another line 
from where the execution will return after the macro call has completed. 
Reentering the line after such an excursion to an other line will 
cause this counter to be incremented. In summary, this counter might 
reflect the number of partial executions of a line not the number 
of full executions of the entire line. 
.TP
6. average 
The average time spent in the line is simply computed by dividing the 
value in column 4 by the value in column 5. 
.TP
7. file 
The input file name. The corresponding file number is shown in column 1. 
.RE
.RS
.PP
.RE
.TP
texprofile \fB\-G\fP \fIhello\fP
 With the option \fB\-G\fP,
texprofile
will map each time stamp 
either to file input or to a macro body. 
The table shown is divided into several sections, the first section 
is devoted to file input, each of the following section is devoted 
to a specific macro. 
.br
Each section starts with a header. The header of the 
first section is ``File\&'' the header of a later section is the macro name. 
.br
The first line after the header gives the total time spent in the section 
in column 1 and 3 in different formats: 
.RS
.TP
1. time 
Column 1 gives it as an absolut time. 
.TP
3. percentage 
Column 3 gives it as a percentage of the total time measured. 
.RE
.RS
.PP
For the first section with the header ``File\&'', the absolute time 
will be equal to the total time measured because texprof
did spent all the time processing the file \fIhello\fP\&.
And consequently the value in column 3 will be 100%\&. 
.br
To accomplish a task, a macro usually calls other 
macros, that we call child macros in the following. 
The following lines will give a breakdown of the time shown in the 
first line. 
The next line after the header gives the time spent in the section 
excluding the time spent in child macros. It adds in column 4 the number 
of times the macro was called. 
.RS
.RE
.TP
1. time 
Column 1 gives the absolut time spent in the section excluding the time 
spent in child macros 
.TP
3. percentage 
Column 3 gives the time from column 1 as a percentage of the total time 
spent in this section as given in the previous line. 
.TP
4. count/total 
Column 4 gives the number of times the section was called. 
.RE

.SH BUGS

If the last command in a macro body is a macro call, we call this a tail call. 
If such a tail call reads ahead to scan the following input 
for possible arguments, the look\-ahead mechaism of TeX might push further 
macros or new input files on TeX\&'s input stack. 
These entries will remain on top of TeXprof\&'s macro nesting stack, 
even if TeX backs up all these tokens on its input stack. 
This can cause an attribution of runtime to those entries as sub entries 
of the tail call. If this explanation sounds complicated to you, it is 
because the situation is indeed complicated.
