\section{Synopsis}

\Prog{texprofile} [Options] \Arg{inputfile}

\section{Description}
\Prog{texprofile} reads the binary \Arg{inputfile} as produced by
\Prog{texprof}.  The extension \File{.tprof} of the input file can be
omitted. It analyses the data and presents the results in a variety of
tables, either optimized for human readability or as CSV (comma
separated values) files for further processing.

The output is written to the standard output stream where it can be redirected
to a file or viewed immediately.

\section{Options}
There are four types of options: general options, table options,
selection options, and formatting options.

The general options:
\begin{description}
\item[\Opt{-?} \Opt{-h} \Opt{--help}]
  Display a short help text and exit the program.
\item[\Opt{--version}]
  Display the version information and exit.
\end{description}

The table options determine the tables that will be displayed.
These options all use upper case letters.
If no table option is given, only some global information is shown.

\begin{description}
\item[\Opt{-T}]
  Show the table of the top 10 input lines.
\item[\Opt{-G}]
  Show the table of the  macro call graph.
\item[\Opt{-C}]    Show the table of times per TeX command.
\item[\Opt{-L}]    Show the table of times per input line.
\item[\Opt{-R}]    Show the table of raw time stamps.
\item[\Opt{-S}]    Show the table of macro stack changes.
\item[\Opt{-F}]    Show the table of all input files.
\item[\Opt{-M}]    Show the table of all macros called.
\item[\Opt{-A}]    Show important tables (equal to -TGFC) tables.
\item[\Opt{-N}]    Do not show the table of global information.
\end{description}

The selection options allow to reduce the amount of data that is shown
in the table by omitting table entries that contribute little to the
overall runtime.

\begin{description}
\item[\OptArg{-p}{n}] Do not show information for table entries
  with cumulative time below \Arg{n} percent. The default is 1.0 percent.
\item[\OptArg{-t}{n}] Limit the number of input lines shown in the
  table of the ``Top Ten'' to \Arg{n}. This option is only useful
  with the \Opt{-T} option.
\end{description}

The formatting option determine the formatting of the information in the tables
as well as the selection of information that is shown in the tables.

\begin{description}
\item[\Opt{-i}]
  Add the macros file and line numbers after the macro name.
  This option is useful to distinguish two macros that share
  the same name.
\item[\Opt{-m}]
  Optimize output for machine readability. When optimized for human readability,
  times are rounded and given in a short form adding a unit identifier:
  s for seconds, ms for milliseconds, us for micro seconds, and ns for
  nanoseconds. This format is inconvenient if you want to import the data
  for example into a spread-sheet for further processing.
  With the \Opt{-m} option times are simply given in nano seconds without units.
  Similar the combined time for the total time used for a macro and the
  time used as a sub-macro from the call graph is given in a single column
  with a slash separating both numbers is nice for human readers.
  With the \Opt{-m} option both numbers will simply be given in separate columns.
  
\item[\Opt{-n}]
  Show the time stamp numbers. This option is useful together with
  the \Opt{-R} option, if you import the table into a database or spread-sheet.
  If you sort the data by various properties into different
  categories, the time stamp number can be used to keeping the entries
   within a category sorted by time.
  
\item[\Opt{-s}]
  Show the changes of the macro stack.
  This option is useful with the \Opt{-R} option if you want to see the changes
  in the macro stack (see \Opt{-S}) together with the timing information in
  a single table.
\end{description}


\section{Data Formats}
\subsection{File Numbers}
While \Prog{texprof} is running, every TeX input file is given a
unique file number. The file name alone is often not unique because
two files in different directories might have the same file
name. Displaying the full file name with the complete path is however often
not very
convenient. So if you observe the same file name together with
different file numbers, you can use the option \Opt{-F} to get a table of all
file numbers and their full file names.

But even within the same
directory, TeX can read different files with the same name during one
run: TeX can open a file for writing, write content to the file, close
it, open it for reading, read it and close it again. Then TeX might
repeat this process a second time, or multiple times, reusing the same
file name over and over again.  \Prog{texprof} will assign a new file
number to this file each time it is opened for reading. So you can
tell from the sequence of file numbers which one was the first, the
second, or the third.

Last not least, there are some special file
numbers:
\begin{description}
\item[0 - unknown]
  If the file is unknown, which should rarely happen,
  the file number 0 is used.
\item[1- system]
  \Prog{texprof} will map
  time intervals that are used to execute certain system routines
  to the ``system'' pseudo file 
using the line numbers to identify the specific routine
like producing the output DVI file (shipout), breaking
a paragraph into lines (linebrk), or breaking the
document into pages (buildpg). These times do not depend on the
use of macros but simply on the size of the document.
\item[2 - terminal]
  TeX commands entered on the command line or interactively are mapped
  to file number 2.
\end{description}

\subsection{Time}
 If the option \Opt{-m} is given times are given as nanoseconds.
 Otherwise, times are rounded to at most 4 digits precission and displayed
 with a unit: seconds (s), milliseconds (ms), microseconds (um), or nanoseconds (ns).

 \subsection{Macro Names}
  Macro names are shown with the leading backslash.
  Since macro names are often not unique, the command line option \Opt{-i}
  can be used to show after the macro name in square brackets the file number
  and the line number where the macro is defined.
  Unless two macros with the same name are
  defined in the same file and line this is sufficient to uniquely
  identify a macro. A macro defined with ``let'' results in a complet copy
  of the original macro. Therefore it  will not reference
  the file and line of the ``let'' command but the same file and line as
  the original macro.

\section{Examples}
  Let's assume that you issue the command \Prog{texprof} \Opt{-prof} \Arg{hello.tex}.
  This will run \Prog{texprof} on the input file \Arg{hello.tex} with option \Opt{-prof}.
  The program \Prog{texprof} will load the plain TeX format and then
  process \File{hello.tex} to produce \File{hello.log} and \File{hello.dvi}.
  It will execute  exactly the same steps that TeX would execute if you had
  issued the command \Prog{tex} \Arg{hello.tex}.

  In addition to \File{hello.log} and \File{hello.dvi}, \Prog{texprof} will
  also produce the file \File{hello.tprof} containing time measurements
  made while  \Prog{texprof} was running. 
  The option \Opt{-prof} will switch on the gathering of
  timing data as soon as \Prog{texprof} enters its main control procedure;
  The file \File{hello.tprof} will contain a time measurement, called a time
  stamp, for every command that TeX executed while processing the input.
  A binary format is used to store all that data in a simple and compact
  form. Still the file \File{hello.tprof} might become very big.

  The program \Prog{texprofile} is used to extract and analyse the
  data contained in \File{hello.tprof} and produce useful output.
  Here are some examples:
  
\begin{description}
\item[\Prog{texprofile} \Arg{hello}]
  Without further options \Prog{texprofile} will write some general
  information to the standard output, like the total time measured,
  the number of samples, the average time per sample, etc.
  The general information is always given unless explicitely disabled
  with the \Opt{-N} option or with the \Opt{-m} option.

\item[\Prog{texprofile} \Opt{-T} \Arg{hello}]
  With the option \Opt{-T}, \Prog{texprofile} will map each time stamp
  to a specific line of input, add up the time intervalls for each input
  line separately, and output a table showing the ten lines that have
  the highest cummulative time.
  The table has the following seven columns:
  \begin{description}
  \item[1. file]
    The first column contains the input file number as explained above.
    The input file name if shown in column 7.

  \item[2. line]
    The line number.
  \item[3. percent]
    The time spent in this line and file as a percentage of the total
    time measured as given as part of the general information.
  \item[4. absolute]
    The absolute time spent in this line and file.
  \item[5. count]
    The number of times the execution path entered this line.
    Note, that a
    macro call usually redirects the execution path to another line
    from where the execution will return after the macro call has completed.
    Reentering the line after such an excursion to an other line will
    cause this counter to be incremented. In summary, this counter might
    reflect the number of partial executions of a line not the number
    of full executions of the entire line.
  \item[6. average]
    The average time spent in the line is simply computed by dividing the
    value in column 4 by the value in column 5.
  \item[7. file]
    The input file name. The corresponding file number is shown in column 1.
  \end{description}

\item[\Prog{texprofile} \Opt{-G} \Arg{hello}]
  With the option \Opt{-G}, \Prog{texprofile} will map each time stamp
  either to file input or to a macro body.
  The table shown is divided into several sections, the first section
  is devoted to file input, each of the following section is devoted
  to a specific macro.
  \\
  Each section starts with a header. The header of the
  first section is ``File'' the header of a later section is the macro name.
  \\
  The first line after the header gives the total time spent in the section
  in column 1 and 3 in different formats:
  \begin{description}
    \item[1. time]
      Column 1 gives it as an absolut time.
    \item[3. percentage]
      Column 3 gives it as a percentage of the total time measured.
  \end{description}
  For the first section with the header ``File'', the absolute time
  will be equal to the total time measured because \Prog{texprof}
  did spent all the time processing the file \Arg{hello}.
  And consequently the value in column 3 will be 100\%.
  \\
  To accomplish a task, a macro usually calls other
  macros, that we call child macros in the following.
  The following lines will give a breakdown of the time shown in the
  first line.
  The next line after the header gives the time spent in the section
  excluding the time spent in child macros. It adds in column 4 the number
  of times the macro was called.
  \begin{description}
    \item[1. time]
      Column 1 gives the absolut time spent in the section excluding the time
      spent in child macros
    \item[3. percentage]
      Column 3 gives the time from column 1 as a percentage of the total time
      spent in this section as given in the previous line.
    \item[4. count/total]
      Column 4 gives the number of times the section was called.
  \end{description}

  

\end{description}


\section{Bugs}
If the last command in a macro body is a macro call, we call this a tail call.
If such a tail call reads ahead to scan the following input
for possible arguments, the look-ahead mechaism of TeX might push further
macros or new input files on TeX's input stack.
These entries will remain on top of TeXprof's macro nesting stack,
even if TeX backs up all these tokens on its input stack.
This can cause an attribution of runtime to those entries as sub entries
of the tail call. If this explanation sounds complicated to you, it is
because the situation is indeed complicated.
