.SH NAME
afm2tfm \- convert Adobe font metrics to TeX font metrics
.SH DESCRIPTION
PostScript fonts are (or should be) accompanied by font metric files
such as
.B Times-Roman.afm,
which describes the characteristics of the font called Times-Roman.
To use such fonts with TeX, we need TFM files that contain similar
information. This program does that conversion.  For more
information, see the dvips documentation.
.SH FILES
.I psfonts.map
in the config directory used by dvips.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
dvips(1), tex(1), vptovf(1), fontinst(1), afm2pl(1), otftotfm(1)
.SH BUGS
An option to add letterspacing to the virtual font was rejected by Knuth
because it would make the fi and fl ligatures break the normal rhythmic
pattern.

Tomas Rokicki and Donald E. Knuth.  Send bug reports to tex-k@tug.org.
