Note that this is is a *partial* repackaging of elements of the DVIOUT
package by Toshio OSHIMA, Yoshiki OTOBE, and Kazunori ASAYAMA.
Here we just want dvispc, chkfont and propw. Small description:

* chkfont.exe  : A utility to check font in DVI/TFM/JFM/FONT files
* chkfont.txt  : Document of chkfont.exe (in Japanese)
* dvispc.exe   : A utilty to correct the page-independence of DVI file using 
                 color specials or tpic specials and to transform between 
                 a DVI file and a text file
* dvispc.txt   : A document of dvispc.exe (in Japanese)
* dvispce.txt  : A document of dvispc.exe
* propw.exe    : A utility to make jfm files for Japanese proportional font
* propw0.txt   : Document of propw.exe (in Japanese)

All files in this repository are encoded in CP932 (LF), as in tug.org
subversion repository.
If you like to compile these files on Unix system, convert encodings
by executing following commands:
  $ iconv -f CP932 -t UTF-8 propw.c >propw.c.utf8
  $ mv propw.c.utf8 propw.c
If you like to distribute these files (especially .txt documents) on
Windows, it might be better to convert LF to CRLF (CP932 should be kept):
  $ nkf -Ss -Lw --overwrite propw0.txt
The LF -> CRLF conversion is suggested in tug.org subversion repository,
under trunk/distribution/ directory.
