Note that this is is a *partial* repackaging of elements of the DVIOUT
package by Toshio OSHIMA, Yoshiki OTOBE, and Kazunori ASAYAMA.
Here we just want dvispc, chkfont and propw. Small description:

* chkdvifont[.exe]  : A utility to check font in DVI/TFM/JFM/FONT files
                      (formerly chkfont.exe; renamed due to name conflicts)
* chkdvifont-ja.txt : Document of chkdvifont.exe (in Japanese)
                      (formerly chkfont.txt)
* dvispc[.exe]   : A utility to correct the page-independence of DVI file
                   using color specials or tpic specials and
                   to transform between a DVI file and a text file
* dvispc-ja.txt  : A document of dvispc.exe (in Japanese)
                   (formerly dvispc.txt)
* dvispc-en.txt  : A document of dvispc.exe
                   (formerly dvispce.txt)

The followings are not (currently) added.

* propw[.exe]    : A utility to make jfm files for Japanese proportional font
* propw-ja.txt   : Document of propw.exe (in Japanese)
                   (formerly propw0.txt)

All files in the GitHub repository
  https://github.com/aminophen/dviout-util
are encoded in CP932 (LF), as in tug.org subversion repository
  https://www.tug.org/svn/dviout/trunk/
If you like to compile these files on Unix system, convert encodings
by executing following commands:
  $ iconv -f CP932 -t UTF-8 propw.c >propw.c.utf8
  $ mv propw.c.utf8 propw.c
If you like to distribute these files (especially .txt documents) on
Windows, it might be better to convert LF to CRLF (CP932 should be kept):
  $ nkf -Ss -Lw --overwrite propw0.txt
The LF -> CRLF conversion is suggested in tug.org subversion repository,
under trunk/distribution/ directory.
